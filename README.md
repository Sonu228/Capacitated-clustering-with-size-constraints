# Capacitated-clustering-with-size-constraints.
# import all required library.
# input: genrate random matrix of size m.n and interge k , p, q. 
# constuct Bipartite Graph and assign weight.
# find minimum weight perfect matching and make cluster crossoponding to matching 
# find median of all cluster 
# Repeat until there is nothng changes happen.

# for reducing the runing time i will implement 4 approch 
# Goal of all approch is to find Good median
